# Contributing

We really appreciate your interest in contributing to the project! We need volunteer developers to help this project reach its potential.

This document describes guidelines for contributing to the NWA project. Feel free to propose changes to this guide in a pull request. 

We recommend you gain familiarity with the project by setting up your own NWA system based on installation guides on the [main site](https://nwa-site.herokuapp.com/). This way, you have a setup to test the software on. However, this is not a necessity, and you can definitely still contribute with no hardware. Issues that require hardware are labeled with the 'hardware required' label.

If you want to contribute to development but are new to software development, or find the project a bit daunting, you can start by checking whether there are any issues labeled ['good first issue'](https://github.com/neighborhood-watch-alarm/nwa/labels/good%20first%20issue).

### Important resources
**Mailing list**: We would love to have you subscribed to our mailing list at nwa-forum@googlegroups.com, so you won't miss any development related diskussions. This is currently also the forum where users can ask for help with the system, and we would love your support in answering any questions from users.</br>
**Code of Conduct**: Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/neighborhood-watch-alarm/nwa/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing to this project. 

## Bugs and feature requests
You are welcome to report a bug or suggest a new feature. This is done by creating an [Issue](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue).
If you discover a bug that is a breach in the security of the alarm system, please do not create an Issue, but instead send an email describing the issue to the trusted developers of the project: nwa-gov@googlegroups.com

## Testing
When implementing changes in the Java code for the server, please write jUnit tests where applicable.

## Submitting changes
Please send a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) via [the nwa Github](https://github.com/simoneengelbr/nwa/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done.

## Contribution notes
This is a young project built on code from two different university projects, and documentation, coding style, and test coverage is not yet fully developed. We are working on improving this, and would love your help:

When submitting a change, any relevant tests should be included, and extra tests are welcomed with open arms. The project has very limited test coverage so far, so any contributions to testing would mean a lot!

If you encounter coding style or documentation that you feel should be improved upon, please feel free to do so.

User-friendly documentation and guides for the system webpage are really important to us in this project, as we want users to be able to assemble and use the system with minimal need for technical support. If you would like some help with any updates to the website, you can always ask for support from the community at nwa-forum@googlegroups.com.

Thank you for contributing!
